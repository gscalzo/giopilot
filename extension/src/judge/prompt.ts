 * The per-post judge runs on a compact DETECTION rubric distilled from the
 * humanizer skill, not on the full ~30KB rewriting skill (ADR 0009):
 *
 *   - skills/humanizer/SKILL.md — the upstream skill, vendored verbatim
 *     (provenance in UPSTREAM.json); input to distillation, never sent per post.
 *   - skills/humanizer/DISTILLED.md — the bundled distilled snapshot (below).
 *   - config.distilledSkill — a fresher distillation produced at runtime by
 *     Options → Update skill from GitHub (download → distill with a stronger
 *     model → store).
 *   - config.skillText — a user override that beats both.
 *
 * The judging preamble and JSON output contract are code-owned and always
 * wrap the rubric, so no update or edit can break parsing.
